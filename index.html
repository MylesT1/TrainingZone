<p id="content">Our Mission</p>
<p id="footer">The Training Zone web site is intended to increase revenue for Training Zone by promoting the services offered by the company and increasing new and repeat customers.</p>

<p id="content">Target Audience</p>
<p id="footer">Local residents, mostly between the ages of 28 and 50 form the majority of our current audience (mature age job seekers), and this is who the site is aimed at..</p>

<p id="content">Success Evaluation</p>
<p id="footer">Other advertising will be consistent for a period of 3 months (except for including the new web site), so that any increase in sales should be attributable to the site. At the end of this 3 month period (and during), the number of new customers will be counted and compared to the previous 3 months.</p>
